The Numbers: Siegenthaler said exchanges enjoyed a near-perfect storm in the first quarter of 2022 thanks in part to the stock market correction, Russia-Ukraine conflict and rapidly rising interest rate expectations, all of which drove trading volume higher. In the second quarter, trading volumes declined to a more historically normalized level.

The stock market index just turned in its worst first half since 1970 with several macro trends playing out. Here’s a look at what happened and what could be next.
What Happened: The S&P 500 closed the month of June at $3,785.38. The index had its worst first half of a year since 1970 and posted the worst quarter since the first quarter of 2020, a period that included the official declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Among the underlying issues hurting the stock market in the first half of 2022 were the Russia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 lockdowns in areas such as China and rising inflation. The Labor Department reported an 8.6% increase in the Consumer Price Index in mid-June, the highest inflation rating since 1981.
LPL Financial reported that the first 100 trading days of 2022 were the fourth-worst start for the S&P 500, trailing only 1932 (Great Depression), 1940 (World War II) and 1970 (Vietnam War and recession).

The Trades: At 8:07:56 a.m. an institution traded 111,000 shares of USO at $81.16. A few minutes later, at 8:10:41 a.m., another order for 111,000 USO shares went through at the same price. Together, the two trades amount to an $18.01 million bet on the fund.
USO was trading higher by about 1.7% at press time, putting the institutions who traded the stocks into the green, if the trades were a purchase of shares.
USO has retraced about 11% from its June 8 52-week high of $92.20 and on Friday, the fund was forming an inside bar pattern, with all of the price action taking place within Thursday's range. The inside is neutral in this case because although USO was trading lower before forming the inside bar, Friday's price action was taking place near the top of Thursday's range.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY) received approval for its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Breyanzi for large B-cell lymphoma, while it withdrew its application for Reblozyl as a treatment option for anemia in adults with non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia.
Spero Therapeutics Inc's (NASDAQ: SPRO) new drug application (NDA) for its complicated urinary-tract infection candidate was shot down by the FDA with a CRL.

On The Mortgage Front: Freddie Mac (OTC: FMCC) reported the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.70% as of June 30, 2022, down from last week when it averaged 5.81%. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.83%, down from last week when it averaged 4.92%. And the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 4.50%, up from last week when it averaged 4.41%.
“The rapid rise in mortgage rates has finally paused, largely due to the countervailing forces of high inflation and the increasing possibility of an economic recession,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “This pause in rate activity should help the housing market rebalance from the breakneck growth of a seller’s market to a more normal pace of home price appreciation.”
While mortgage rates inched down, home loan application volume inched up. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, was up by 0.7% for the week ending June 24 from the previous week. The Purchase Index recorded a 0.1% uptick and the Refinance Index increased 2% from the previous week.
Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, stated the “decline in mortgage rates led to a slight increase in refinancing, driven by an uptick in conventional loans. However, refinances are still 80% lower than a year ago and more than 60% below the historical average. Overall purchase activity has weakened in recent months due to the quick jump in mortgage rates, high home prices and growing economic uncertainty.”
Kan added the average purchase loan amount declined to $413,500, down from its $460,000 record peak in March.

(Colorado, U.S.) (Nasdaq: BDSX), a leading data-driven diagnostic solutions company, to incorporate the results of Biodesix’s Nodify Lung® blood-based lung nodule risk assessment testing into Philips Lung Cancer Orchestrator lung cancer patient management system. The incorporation of proteomics data – along with the radiologic and patient history data currently used to determine treatment decisions – can help create diagnostic efficiency for cancer care centers in the management of a growing number of lung nodule cases, via the contextual launch of Biodesix Nodify Lung application within Lung Cancer Orchestrator. Philips Lung Cancer Orchestrator solution is designed to enable health systems to operationalize lung cancer screening and lung nodule management programs at scale.Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide [1], with current 5-year survival rates after diagnosis typically less than 20% [2]. If detected and treated early, however, research shows 10-year survival rates could increase to more than 90% [3]. Thanks to the adoption of low-dose CT (computer tomography) screening and better management of incidental lung nodule findings, early-stage diagnosis and treatment is now possible, but has resulted in rapidly increasing caseloads. For example, recent changes in U.S. guidelines have nearly doubled the number of people now eligible for lung cancer screening [4].“By incorporating Biodesix’s Nodify Lung testing, we take another step in leveraging integrated diagnostics from imaging, genomics, and now proteomic results from a simple blood draw to address key moments in the lung cancer patient journey, support care team decision-making, and help health systems learn from their practice patterns in a dashboard view,” said Louis Culot, General Manager Oncology Informatics and Genomics at Philips. “We expect the inclusion of Biodesix’s ground-breaking technology in Philips Lung Cancer Orchestrator to help drive more confident decisions for the care team, and ultimately benefit patients.”As a next-step after radiologic lung nodule assessment, minimally-invasive biopsy procedures such as endobronchial biopsy (accessing a nodule via the patient’s airways), are already helping early-stage diagnosis. With 62% of biopsies conducted on benign nodules [5], by detecting the presence of blood-based biomarkers combined with clinical and radiomic factors, Biodesix’s Nodify Lung blood-based proteomic tests help clinicians to reclassify the risk of malignancy to better target resources to those who need them. If a nodule is malignant, the delay in surgical care for cancer patients by four weeks increases the mortality by 6-8% [6].“We are delighted that our tests are being incorporated into Philips’ vision for end-to-end cancer care management using a multi-diagnostic approach,” said Scott Hutton, Chief Executive Officer at Biodesix. “By integrating our Nodify® tests in Philips Lung Cancer Orchestrator we hope to make these tests more accessible to physicians and patients and more easily utilized by care teams with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes.”Philips Lung Cancer Orchestrator is an integrated patient management system for CT lung cancer screening programs and incidental lung nodule findings that keeps track of patients, appointments, diagnostic images, test results, and clinical decisions for every step of a lung cancer patient’s screening and treatment journey. Fitting seamlessly into conventional screening and diagnostic workflows, it coordinates the end-to-end patient journey to create a fully traceable, fully documented timeline of scheduled actions, and aggregates data on tumor staging, radiology, pathology, and biomarker analyses for informed decision-making. The ability to order and receive the results expedites Biodesix’s proteomic testing directly to and from the Lung Cancer Orchestrator at the same time it adds new insights on nodule risk of malignancy to further support the decision-making process.Lung Cancer Orchestrator is part of Philips’ expanding portfolio of integrated cancer care solutions that seamlessly connect data, technology, operations, and clinical workflows to enable pivotal decision-making. Visit Philips Oncology to learn how Philips combines smart diagnostic and imaging technologies with connected workflows that integrate patient data from disparate systems, to provide solutions that put expert information at clinicians’ fingertips to help expand the quality and reach of personalized cancer care.[1] International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization.
